    description= _ "The ultimate expression of the saurian spear tradition. Clad in only light armor, a Saurian Pikebearer wields a pike nearly three times his own height. What these saurians lack in individual mass, they make up for in disciplined formation, speed of maneuver, and the terrifying leverage of their long weapons. They cannot hold a line as densely as human pikemen, but their formations are more fluid, able to reposition rapidly to block a breach or exploit an opening. Against a charging foe, however, the effect is the same: a sudden, impenetrable forest of spearpoints that appears where moments before there seemed only open ground."
